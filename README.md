# JavaScript Studies

Hey there!

This is my quick "cheat sheet" for the JavaScript classes that I am attending. 

The purpose here is mostly to help me organize my studies and test what I am learning. However, it also displays the topics that I am studying.

I will update this repo constantly throughout my classes.

If you have any tips and/or want to reach out, feel free to check my contacts on my Github bio.
